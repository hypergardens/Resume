                            In a nutshell, I create digital experiences, design learning paths for young people,
                            and pursue several artforms. Outside of my longer-term positions, I have been on many
                            small-scale projects, technical and artistic.

                            I am passionate about the natural sciences, programming and data science, game design,

                            projects. I am returning to programming as a career, and my experiences are diverse and
                            built transferrable skills.</p>

                        <p>This fills the gap for what I've been doing besides volunteering. I never stopped creating,
                            coding, diversifying.
                            I've programmed add-ons and
                            mods for games, participated in code jams, studied statistics, probabilistic models and game
                            design.

                            I have worked on several paid and unpaid "gigs" on the technical and artistic side, each not
                            big enough for its own entry (but I like sharing them).

                            On the hands-on side, I built a lab, complete with a forge and toolkit for various crafts.
